The original problem statement was:
Given the range of integer numbers from -3 to 3, print out all the possible combinations of quadratic equations, and include proper format regarding the sign of the number.
Examples:

a=2,b=-3,c=1
2x^2 -3x +1

a=-1,b=2,c=0
-x^2 +2x

a=0,b=1,c-1
x-1

a=2, b=0, c=3
2x^2 + 3
